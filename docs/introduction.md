## What is Pglet

Pglet (*"pagelet"*) is a rich user interface (UI) framework for scripts and programs written in any language. [Python](/docs/tutorials/python), [Bash](/docs/tutorials/bash), [PowerShell](/docs/tutorials/powershell) and [JavaScript](/docs/tutorials/javascript) are already supported and other languages can be easily added via [Pglet protocol](/docs/reference/protocol).

Pglet renders web UI, so you can easily [build web apps](/docs/quickstart) with your favorite language. Knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript is not required as you build UI with [controls](/docs/reference/controls). Pglet controls are built with [Fluent UI React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web) to ensure your programs look cool and professional.

## How it works

Pglet UI does not become embedded into your program, but is being served by an out-of-process Pglet server. Application state and control flow logic lives in your persistent-process program while UI changes and events are communicated to Pglet server via IPC-based [protocol](/docs/reference/protocol). It allows writing web app as a standalone monolith without any knowledge of request/response model, routing, templating or state management. Pglet server can be run locally, self-hosted in your local network or used as a [hosted service](https://pglet.io).

In a classic client-server architecture front-end communicates to a one or more back-end services. Pglet implements an opposite approach where multiple back-end services scattered across internal network behind a firewall communicate to a centralized Pglet server, i.e. front-end service, installed in DMZ or [hosted as a service](https://pglet.io). This design gives a number of advantages:

* Secure by design - your internal services and critical data stay behind the firewall and not accessible from the outside world.
* Apps running next to services and data they process - faster/cheaper access and maximum security.
* Zero deployment - run apps on any server in your network or your development machine, no need to deploy apps to a web server.

## Use cases

* Progress visualization for CI/CD workflows, batch jobs and cron tasks 
* Admin interfaces for internal services
* Web dashboards and monitoring
* Status pages
* Executive reporting
* Registration forms and questionnaires
* Intranet self-service kiosks
* Prototype and throw-away apps
