Pglet (*"pagelet"*) is a rich user interface (UI) framework for scripts and programs written in any language. [Python](/docs/tutorials/python), [Bash](/docs/tutorials/bash), [PowerShell](/docs/tutorials/powershell) and [JavaScript](/docs/tutorials/javascript) are already supported; other languages can be easily added via [Pglet protocol](/docs/reference/protocol).

Pglet renders web UI, so you can easily [build web apps](/docs/quickstart) with your favorite language. Knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript is not necessary as you build UI with [controls](/docs/reference/controls). Pglet controls are built with [Fluent UI React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web) to ensure your programs look cool and professional.

Pglet UI does not become embedded into your program, but is being served by an out-of-process Pglet server. While the application state and control flow logic lives in your program all UI changes and events are communicated to Pglet server via IPC-based [protocol](/docs/reference/protocol). Pglet server can be run locally, self-hosted in your local network or used as a [hosted service](https://pglet.io).
