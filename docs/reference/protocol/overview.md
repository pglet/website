Pglet is a language-agnostic UI server which can be run locally, self-hosted in your local network or used as a [hosted service](/docs/pglet-service).

One of the design goals of Pglet was comfort progress updates from CI/CD workflows, internal tools and scheduled jobs written in Bash and PowerShell, so the protocol had to be simple and fast.

The protocol is text-based and was partially inspired by [Redis protocol](https://redis.io/topics/protocol).

## Communication channel

Pglet client is used to establish a communication channel with Pglet service. Client is a part of `pglet` (or `pglet.exe` on Windows) executable which is automatically downloaded by a client library you use or can be downloaded manually from [releases](https://github.com/pglet/pglet/releases).

For every new connection to a page (`pglet page <name>`) or a new app session (`pglet app <name>`) Pglet client creates two [FIFO named pipes](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/fifo.7.html) on macOS/Linux or two [named pipes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes) on Windows:

* **Command pipe** - bi-directional pipe for sending command requests and receiving responses.
* **Event pipe** - read-only pipe with a constant stream of events (click, change, etc.) generated by a user.

Pglet client returns the name/path of command pipe and to get the name of event pipe append `.events` to a command pipe name.

## Command messages

### Request

Each request to a command pipe represents a single- or multi-line command in the format:

```
<command> [value_1] [value_2] ... [property_1=value] [property_2=value] ...
```

For example, command adding a new `Text` control to a page:

```
add text value="Hello, world!"
```

or adding multiple controls at once to a stack named `footer`:

```
add to=footer
  textbox id=firstName
  button id=cancel text=Cancel
```

Properties parsing is quite relaxed. If the value doesn't have spaces you can ommit quotes, for example `text=Hello`. Both single and double quotes can be used to enclose the value with spaces, for example: `value="World's best coffee"`, or `value='"quoted" text'`. The following escape symbols are supported: `\n`, `\t`, `\"`, `\'`.

### Response

Successful response has the following format:

```
<number_of_additional_result_lines> [value]
result_line_1
result_line_2
...
```

For example, the result of `get firstName value` command reading the `value` property of `firstName` textbox might look like:

```
0 John Smith
```

If you are reading the value of `multiline=true` textbox then the result will look like:

```
2 First line
Second line
Third line
```

where `2` means "result has 2 more lines".

The response of commands non-returning any values is just `0 `.

:::note
Certain commands may not have a response at all. These are fire-and-forget commands with the names ending on "f": `addf`, `setf`, `appendf`, `cleanf`, `removef`. Fire-and-forget commands are handy when you are quickly doing a lot of control modifications and don't care about the results, for example, updaing progress bar in a loop.

## Events

Read event pipe to wait and receive events fired by users interacting with a web page.

Each event message is a single line in the format:

```
<event_target> <event_name> [event_data]
```

where `<event_target>` is ID of a control generated the event, `<event_name>` is event name, e.g. `click`, `change` and `[event_data]` is optional event data attached to a control with `data` property (usually, used with buttons).

For example, a serie of event might look like:

```
firstName change John
agreeTOS change true
ok click
cancel click
...
```
