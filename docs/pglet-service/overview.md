<p style={{fontSize: '16pt'}}>Pglet Service is a secure, always updated, highly-available and fault-tolerant installation of Pglet server.</p>

When your program or script using Pglet is ready and tested you can start "streaming" its UI to a centralized Pglet server installed in your organization or a hosted Pglet service.

Use Pglet service if you need to instantly bring your apps to the web rather than dealing with a hosting of your own Pglet server instance and all the related hassle such as securing a web server, installing SSL certificates, updating Pglet server and underlying OS, doing backups.

To redirect application UI to Pglet hosted service:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="languages" defaultValue="python" values={[
  { label: 'Python', value: 'python', },
  { label: 'Bash', value: 'bash', },
  { label: 'PowerShell', value: 'powershell', },
  { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'javascript', },
]}>

<TabItem value="python">

Add `web=True` to `pglet.page` or `pglet.app` calls:

```python
p = pglet.page(web=True)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bash">

Add `PGLET_WEB=true` before `pglet_page` or `pglet_app` calls:

```bash
PGLET_WEB=true pglet_page
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="powershell">

Add `-Web` parameter to `Connect-PgletPage` or `Connect-PgletApp` calls:

```powershell
Connect-PgletPage -Web
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="javascript">

Add `{ web: true }` option to `pglet.page` or `pglet.app` calls:

```javascript
  let p = await pglet.page({ web: true });
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Naming pages

Pglet page URLs have the following format:

```
https://app.pglet.io/{account_name}/{page_name}
```

`{account_name}` and `{page_bane}` should be max 60 symbols and consists of `a-z`, `0-9` and '-'.

`{account_name}` is a namespace and could be your username or organization name.

`{account_name}` defaults to `public` if not specified for a new page or app.

`{page_name}` defaults to a random string under `public` account if not specified for a new page or app. 

## Beta limitations

During the beta Pglet hosted service is working in a public non-authenticated mode with some constraints applied.
Anonymous clients are tracked by IP address, so there might be situations when many users from the same network quickly exhaust allowed quotas.

### Pages

* `{account_name}` can be anything.
* Anonymous client can create up to 10 pages per hour.
* Once a page is created from a certain IP it must be updated from the same IP; otherwise page name could not be reused untill the page is expired and its name reclaimed.
* Shared page lifetime is limited to 6 hours since the last time it was updated.
* App page lifetime is limited to 60 minutes since the last time any app session was updated.

### Sessions

* Anonymous client can create up to 10 app sessions per hour.
* App page session lifetime is limited to 60 minutes since the last time it was accessed or updated.
* When a host client serving an app page is disconnected all app sessions are immediately invalidated.
  That's a convenient "feature" during beta-testing because when user restarts the app and refreshes the page in the browser they'll start a new session.

### Page size

* Maximum size of a page or app session is limited to 1 MB.
