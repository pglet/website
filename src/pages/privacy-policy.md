        <li>Knowledge and Consent

                    in this Policy. Pglet may amend this Policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Collection of Information
            <ol>
                <li>Pglet collects personal information in three ways.
                    <ol>
                        <li>First, our website uses cookies. These cookies are automatically placed on your computer or mobile device that uniquely identify your browser or device. We use cookies to personalize content and ads, to provide social media features and to analyse our traffic. We also share information about your use of our site with our social media, advertising and analytics partners who may combine it with other information that you’ve provided to them or that they’ve collected from your use of their services. By using our website, you are consenting to our use of cookies.</li>
                        <li>Second, we collect personal information that you provide to us through our Site. If you create an account with us, the personal information that you provide is used for the purposes set forth in Section 3.2, below. If, when you create an account, you use the option to sign up with you existing developer account, we may receive additional personal information about you depending on your settings with such developer account. If we receive information additional to your name and email address, you expressly consent to us receiving and processing that information for the purposes set forth in Section 3.2, below. If you also consent to receiving emails from us, either when you create an account or at any other time, we will use the personal information you provide for the purposes set forth in Section 3.3, below.</li>
                        <li>Finally, if a user creates an account, that person is the “Account Owner.” The Account Owner may invite other users (each, an “Invited Users”) to the same account by entering the email address of the Invited User as indicated in our Services.  We use such email address solely for the purposes of delivering the invitation. No other personal information is collected about the Invited User unless the invitation is accepted and the Terms and Conditions of this Privacy Policy are consented to. We keep the email address of the Invited User until the earliest of one of the following: (i) the Owner deletes the invitation; (ii) the account for which the invitation is deleted; or (iii) the Invited User sends us a request to delete the invitation (such requests can be made in writing to <a href="mailto:hello@pglet.io">hello@pglet.io</a>.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>We collect the names, emails addresses and IP addresses of all account Users. If you sign up for a paid account, we will also collect your billing information (name and address). We use encrypted technology to process your payment through our third party payment processor (Stripe), which means we never have access to your credit card details. Occasionally, we may request additional personal information for the specific purpose of providing Services that require that information. If you are the Owner of an account, then you can make a written request to have your account deleted by writing to <a href="mailto:hello@pglet.io">hello@pglet.io</a>. We will delete your account within 30 days, along with the personal information of any User associated with that account.  If you are not the account Owner, you can make a request to the Owner of the account to remove you from the account. You can also write us directly at <a href="mailto:hello@pglet.io">hello@pglet.io</a> to request removal. When you are removed, all of your personal information associated with that account is also deleted. Note that deleting your account or removing yourself from an account does not remove you from our mailing list, but you can unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time. We use the personal information provided through your account to administer our Services to you, as more specifically set forth below:
                    <ol>

                        to <a href="mailto:privacy@pglet.io">privacy@pglet.io</a>. To the extent that any of your information is processed for direct marketing purpose, we

                        we will evaluate your objection and respond within 30 days. Please bear in mind that if you object, this may affect
