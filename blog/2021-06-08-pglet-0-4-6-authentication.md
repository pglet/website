The major feature of Pglet 0.4.6 release is built-in authentication and authorization. Pglet now allows creating protected pages and apps which require users to sign in with any of three methods: GitHub, Google or Microsoft account (Azure AD):

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="/img/blog/auth/pglet-signin-example.png" width="70%" /></p>

Just imagine, you can instantly add authentication to any of your backend scripts!

For example, in Python to create a page accessible to GitHub user with username `ExampleUser` and all users in `myorg/Developers` team:

```python
page = pglet.page(permissions="github:ExampleUser, github:myorg/Developers")
```

To allow access to specific Azure AD groups/roles you need to specify their full name including tenant ID, for example:

```python
page = pglet.page(permissions="{tenant-guid}/GroupA")
```

To give access to users authenticating with any method and `@custom-domain.com` email domain:

```python
page = pglet.page(permissions="*@custom-domain.com")
```


## Other changes and improvements

### Web mode by default

Starting from this relase when you start a new page or multi-user app with default parameters its UI will be streamed to https://console.pglet.io. To create a local page add `local=True` parameter (Python), for example:

```python
page = pglet.page("my-app", local=True) # this page will start a local Pglet server
page.add(Text('Hello, localhost!'))
```

### console.pglet.io

Pglet hosted service was moved from `app.pglet.io` domain to `console.pglet.io` to emphasize the fact that Pglet is a secure web "console" where your backend apps can output reach progress.

### Dark theme added and is now default

Pglet provides two built-in themes: `dark` and `light` and you can configure custom theme. To set page theme change its `theme` property, for example:

```python
page = pglet.page("my-app")
page.theme = 'light'
page.update()
```

### Re-connecting client

A serious stabilization work has been done to make Pglet client more resilient to network fluctuations. Now your Pglet app will stay online for many days, reliably connected to Pglet service.

### Python package includes executables

[Pglet package](https://pypi.org/project/pglet/) now includes `pglet` executables for all platforms, so they are downloaded during the package installation - that better works for corporate or k8s environments without outbound internet access.
