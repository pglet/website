We've just released Pglet 0.2.0!

A ton of new controls were added such as navigation menu, toolbar, grid, tabs, dialog and panel. Now we feel confident Pglet allows to fully unleash your creativity and build a user interface of any complexity!

## New features

### ARM support

This release adds binaries for Linux ARM and Apple Silicon M1 - Go 1.16 made that possible. Now you can add remote web UI to your Raspberry PI apps or control what's going on in any IoT device.

### Docker image

Docker image [`pglet/server`](https://hub.docker.com/r/pglet/server) with self-hosted Pglet Server is now available - run it on a VPS server or drop into your Kubernetes cluster.

### Theming

Theming in Pglet takes similar approach as in [Fluent UI Theme Designer](https://aka.ms/themedesigner) - you choose primary, text, background colors and the theme is auto-magically generated from those colors. To change page theme in Pglet set `page` control properties: `themePrimaryColor`, `themeTextColor`, `themeBackgroundColor`. [Check out Theme demo](https://repl.it/@pglet/bash-theme-example)!

## Improved controls

**Button** - additional types of Button control were implemented: compound buttons, icon buttons, toolbar, action and link buttons, buttons with context menus and split buttons. [Check out Buttons demo](https://repl.it/@pglet/bash-buttons-example)!

**Text** - You can now control the styling of Text control such as color and background as well as border properties and text alignment within it (vertical alignment in center works too!). [Check out Text demo](https://repl.it/@pglet/bash-text-example)!

## Other fixes and improvements

* Controls are based on Fluent UI 8.
* `replace` command.
* Event ticker to avoid hanging event loops.
* Pglet Server now does not allow remote host clients by default. Remote hosts clients can be enabled with `ALLOW_REMOTE_HOST_CLIENTS=true` environment variable. [Pglet Server Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pglet/server) set this variable by default.
