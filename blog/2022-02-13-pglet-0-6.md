Notable changes:

* Added `focused` property, `on_focus` and `on_blur` events to all input controls - paving the way to a proper validation support.
* New [`Persona`](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/persona) control.
* New [`ComboBox`](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/combobox) control.
* New `page` events: `connect` and `disconnect` for real-time chat-like experiences.
* Harmonization of border styling propeties across `Stack`, `Image`, `IFrame` and `Text` controls: HTML-ish `border` property with mixed and confusing to non-web devs semantics (`1px solid black` or `solid 1px black`?) replaced with clean and simple `border_style`, `border_width` and `border_color` properties.
* All boolean and enum-like properties are protected with [`beartype`](https://github.com/beartype/beartype).
* Fixed all Python tests to ensure [Pglet works nice with Python 3.7 and above](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pglet/pglet-python). Big shout-out to [@mikaelho](https://github.com/mikaelho) for helping with that!
* [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) was adopted as official Python formatting tools.
* Generating [platform-specific wheels](https://pypi.org/project/pglet/#files) (`.whl`) with one `pglet` executable inside only: smaller wheels - faster installation!
