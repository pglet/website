We've just released [Pglet v0.5](https://github.com/pglet/pglet/releases/tag/v0.5.5)!

While working on this release [Pglet made HN home page](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29349945), got included into [TLDR newsletter](https://messaged.com/tldr/) and crossed the line of [500 stars on GitHub](https://github.com/pglet/pglet) (hey, if you enjoy using Pglet give it a ‚≠êÔ∏è)! That was exciting - we received great feedback from real users! Many of those comments/requests were incorporated in the release.

## Faster WebSocket-based clients

Why?

Graceful application finalization

Versioning for Pglet and clients

## License changed to Apache 2.0

It looks like initially licensing Pglet under AGPL was "premature optimization". Yes, we would like to monetize Pglet with a hosted service and AGPL would stop big cloud providers from forking our service and incorporating it into their cloud offerings, but Pglet is very young project and, honestly, right now we don't foresee Microsoft copying it :)

On the other hand (A)GPL is used to be corporate-unfriendly license which reduces Pglet audience and slows adoption. We want every company using Pglet to build their internal tools!

So, for now we decided to change Pglet license to [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/pglet/pglet/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Local mode is now default

In the previous v0.4 release we made "web" mode default, so when you run a simplest "hello, world" app its UI is instantly streamed to https://app.pglet.io/p/{your-page}. It appears to be kind of scary for the initial experience, so in Pglet v0.5 we are reverting back "local" mode as default. As before Pglet Server is conveniently bundled into all client libraries to make local app development/debug as smooth and pleasant as possible.

## We need you!

We need your feedback! If you have a question or request please [submit an issue](https://github.com/pglet/pglet/issues), [start a new discussion](https://github.com/pglet/pglet/discussions) or [drop an email](mailto:hello@pglet.io).

## Where does Pglet go next?

This is a brief roadmap for Pglet project:

* PowerShell guide and examples.
* Node.js/Deno client (it's still based on Pglet v0.4), guide and examples.
* Go client, guide and examples.
* Pglet hosted service into production (optimization, profiling, metrics, monitoring).

Happy New Year! üéÑ Be kind and stay safe! ü§ó
