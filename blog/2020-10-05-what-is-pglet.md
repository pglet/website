#### In short

`Pglet` (pronounced as "*pagelet*") empowers backend developers to easily add user interface (UI) into their internal apps and utilities without any knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#### It is easy to start programming

It's fairly easy these days to start writing programs in any language. You start from "hello, world", look at the language syntax, flow control structures, puts'n'gets for interacting with user, OOP features. Then you continue with basic libraries for math, strings, I/O, networking, databases, etc. and in a few days or weeks you are able to understand and develop quite decent tools and services!

#### Doing frontend is hard

The things are getting more challenging if you need to add a user interface (UI) to your program. In most cases it's web-based UI as we all want fancy, cross-platform and multi-user software with the potential reach to millions of users on the internet.

Web platform ...Web UI is a completely different beast ... Millions of frameworks...

Do you really need a custom design? Different language for client-side?

#### Pglet to the rescue

What if we give developers a set of full-featured UI primitives (components) and the way to arrange/query those components on a page?

...Pglet is a canvas, or hub, if you will, where your program and users interact/work together.
